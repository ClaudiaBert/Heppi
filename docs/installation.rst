Installation
============
Before installing `heppi` you need to install some
dependencies by just calling this function::

    $ pip install requirement.txt --user

Note that the option `--user` installs the packages locally. This is usefull if you are working
on a remote machine as a user.

At the command line::

    $ easy_install heppi

Or, if you have virtualenv wrapper installed::

    $ mkvirtualenv heppi
    $ pip install heppi
